# Dissociative Identity Disorder Simulation
This repository holds the Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) Simulation project made in 3 days during the [11th International UBI Summer](https://ubicomp.oulu.fi/UBISS2023) School in the University of Oulu.

The aim of this project is to raise awareness for the day-to-day life of people suffering from DID. Utilizing VR technology (Valve Index), the user is immersed in the story of a DID patient, who suffers from blackouts, depersonalization, time loss and hears voices. 

The project is implemented in Unreal Engine 5.2 and makes use of different assets from the marketplace, together with a custom plugin called [UBIKSolver](https://github.com/JonasMolgaard/UBIKSolver/tree/acc72b60b03ea22c44aaa474e01c26653f156331).

## Caution!!!
Frame rate is low as the simulation has not been optimized. The movement is thumbstick-based so the user can experience nausea.

## How-to-use
1. Start SteamVR
2. Open DID_Simulation.uproject with Unreal Engine 5.2
3. Click on VR preview
